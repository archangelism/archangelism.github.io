        hello, im calvin gabriel, but you can call me cal. yes, <i>that</i> calvin gabriel, the school shooter from the 2003 movie zero day. no, im not joking. you want me to explain it? fuck, ill try.

        <p style="text-align-last:justify;">im essentially cal gabriel reborn. reincarnated? same shit. i lived my fucked up little life, went through with zero day with andre, and then blew my brains out in the study area of iroquois high at the ripe old age of eighteen. all that blood and brainmatter and fractured bits of skull flew up to the stars alongside my soul, and mixed in with andre's and we became one. five months and <br>twenty-nine days later, i was born in this life. i was born with those same dimples, and blonde hair, and gray-blue eyes. and the same autism, because apparently retardation extends across spacetime.

        <p>nine months and twenty-five days later, andre was reborn into this life as well. he has the same eyes, although he denies it, and he's just as handsome as ever. he denies that, too. it took us twenty-three years and seventeen days to find each other again, and now we'll never be separated ever again. if we die, we die together, just like before. he's my everything. yes, i don't know how to shut up about him.

        <p>as far as labels go... im transsexual. i guess you can call me a trans man but i don't consider it very accurate. boygirl or girlboy is more correct. i think if i really had to give an answer i would just answer transsexual. i enjoy xenogenders a lot, and neopronouns. i used to actively collect them, but i don't really anymore. my pronouns are it/he/she, plus various neopronouns depending on how im feeling.

        <p>sexuality-wise? it's both really complicated and incredibly simple. long answer: i don't know and i never really have. attraction is confusing for me, for a lot of reasons, and separating what genders im into or not into or if im into sex or not into sex is complex. ive used pretty much every sexuality label under the sun, and none of them fit. now i just say "queer" and leave it at that.

        <p style="text-align-last:center;">short answer: ive only ever truly loved and wanted andre. it's as simple as that.

        <p>i have autism, OCD, and borderline personality disorder. i think... okay, im positive about the autism. im mostly positive about the OCD and pretty sure about the BPD. but there's other shit going on in here i don't know how to categorize. i just say schizoaffective and leave it at that, but there's more to it that i just don't understand. ive been leaning towards maybe NPD or HPD recently, although schizoid could also fit. "overall bad and wrong" is the general idea, with a heavy side of psychosis and delusions.

        <p>im pretty fucked up generally. if me literally being a reincarnation of a fictional school shooter didn't tip you off, im a proud TCC member and have been for a long time. im very adamantly pro-fiction, which makes sense as im a dead dove fiction author. at the moment, i exclusively write fanfiction (you'll never guess what movie i write for) but i have original stories in the works. i don't currently know what media format ill use or where they'll be posted. stay tuned...?

        my least favorite type of people at the moment are chronically online children. and they are children, no matter their age. discourse in general is the bane of my existence. i don't give a shit if things are "problematic," i believe strongly in romanticizing fucked up concepts and actions. i despise posers. preps who saw the alt community trending on tiktok and jumped headfirst into it without any idea of what the communities they're into are about. trendchasers and posers are fucking losers.
