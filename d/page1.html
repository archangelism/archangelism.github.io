    <p>i feel weird today. that's not particularly notable, i feel weird most days. but recently ive just felt so off and im really worried it's effecting andre. it's the love of my life, it means everything to me, and im so worried im going to let it down or ruin things.
        
    <p>i opened up to him about it last night... i think? okay sometime within 48 hours. and it genuinely helped, it did. but im just not well. i think its started to set in that this is real, really happening and not a wonderful dream and i don't know how to let myself be happy. i spent 21 years being miserable and thinking i deserved it, which makes being genuinely happy and content and safe really hard. fuck my back hurts while im writing this i need to fix my posture. im just so worried im gonna fuck this up.
    
    <p>i think it'll be okay. if i haven't fucked up in <u>four months</u> then maybe im not going to at all.
