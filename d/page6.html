    <p> you are the love of my life, my other half, моя родственная душа, my everything. i didn't believe in love until i met you. i'm trying not to get too sappy on the very front page of my website. it's hard not to — all i ever want to do is talk about you, talk to you. every night we fall asleep together but someday soon i will fall asleep in your arms, and wake up next to you. i don't know if you'll ever understand just how much you mean to me. i hope you do, dre. i adore you, baby. i always will.
